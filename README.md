# personal-portfolio
Personal portfolio built using React, showcasing my projects, experience and skills.

## Description
My personal portfolio was developed in React as a way to showcase my projects, experience and skills to potential employers and clients. It was great using React this time around, as opposed to just HTML and CSS back when I was first learning to code. The site is interactive and has smooth scrolling animations + transitions. It is also broken up into different sections with a navigation bar taking you to the corresponding section when clicked. I really enjoyed building this site and am excited to keep adding to it as my projects, skills and experience grow over time.

## Installation
